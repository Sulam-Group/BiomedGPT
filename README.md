# BiomedGPT
[BiomedGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17100) is developed based on [OFA](https://github.com/OFA-Sys/OFA) but pre-trained and fine-tuned with multi-modal & multi-task biomedical datasets. Details are shown in [datasets.md](datasets.md). Feel free to contact us or post issues. 

Please kindly note that this repository is still a work in progress.

- [x] **June 9**: release pre-trained checkpoints; release the data preprocessing and fine-tuning codes for VQA and Captioning. 
- [x] **June 12**: release the data preprocessing and fine-tuning codes for NLI and text summarization. 
- [x] **June 15**: release the data preprocessing and fine-tuning codes for image classification.
- [x] **June 26**: release data preprocessing scripts and codes for pretraining.

# Checkpoints
We provid pretrained checkpoints of BiomedGPT (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vqu1q75m4yz96km/AABuKFaxD57_QC6na1xgXbuEa?dl=0">Dropbox</a>), which can be put in the `scripts/` folder for further development. For finetuned checkpoints, please refer to [checkpoints.md](checkpoints.md). 
## Note:
I recently received a reminder regarding potential policy issues associated with releasing the model checkpoints, due to the fact that not all pretraining / downstream datasets are fully open-sourced. I need to review the relevant policies and licenses to ensure the legality of sharing the weights. Once I can confirm this, I will enable downloading the checkpoints. Thank you for your patience.

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/taokz/BiomedGPT
conda env create -f biomedgpt.yml
python -m pip install pip==21.2.4
pip install fairseq
```
<br></br>


# Implementation
We provide the preprocessing, pretraining, finetuning and inference scripts in the `scripts/` folder. You can follow the directory setting below:

```
BiomedGPT/
â”œâ”€â”€ checkpoints/
â”œâ”€â”€ datasets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pretraining/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ finetuning/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ preprocess/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pretraining/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ finetuning/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pretrain/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vqa/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Pretraining
Please follow [datasets.md](datasets.md) to prepare pretraining datasets, which includes 4 TSV files: <code>vision_language.tsv</code>, <code>text.tsv</code>, <code>image.tsv</code> and <code>detection.tsv</code> in the directory of `./datasets/pretraining/`.

<pre>
cd scripts/pretrain
bash pretrain_tiny.sh
</pre>
Feel free to modify the hyperparameters in the bash script for your requirements or ablation study.

## Downstreams
We provide the run scripts of fine-tuning and inference. There will be log files during execution. Before fine-tuning or inference, please refer to
